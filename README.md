## Introduction

The main of this project is to explain the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) along with a code example such that the reader can follow along and understand each concept with a simple example.

The project is organized across topics based packages. Each package has a sub-package called _usage_ in which the classes are instantiated and called in the main method. 

## Out Of Scope

Since the core purpose of this project is to understand the coding part, tests are out of scope for this project.

## Explanation OOP

OOP languages are built around the concept of objects. OOP improves code readability and reusability. The core concepts are:

- Encapsulation,
- Inheritance, and 
- Polymorphism.

Other concepts explored in this project are:

- Abstraction
- Association
- Aggregation, and
- Composition.

## Explanation Abstraction

## Explanation Encapsulation

Encapsulation allows information hiding, which means it prevents the internal variables of the class from system wide access.

In the project, we have an Animal class and it is used in main() method in which both getters and setters are called. One practical use case could be that a class only provides getters which delivers results based on internal logic of other sub classes but not setters.

## Explanation Polymorphism

## Explanation Inheritance

## Explanation Association

## Explanation Aggregation

## Explanation Composition

## Technologies Used

- Java 11

## Prerequisities

None

## Commands

Since there are multiple classes containing main() method, each of which is targeted at highlighting one specific feature of functional programming in Java, one needs to navigate to the specific main() method and run it in an IDE. 

## Contribution

Feature requests, issues, pull requests and questions are welcome.
