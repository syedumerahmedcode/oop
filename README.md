## Introduction

The main of this project is to explain the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) along with a code example such that the reader can follow along and understand each concept with a simple example.

The project is organized across topics based packages. Each package has a sub-package called _usage_ in which the classes are instantiated and called in the main method. 

## Out Of Scope

Since the core purpose of this project is to understand the coding part, tests are out of scope for this project.

## Explanation OOP

## Explanation Abstraction

## Explanation Encapsulation

## Explanation Polymorphism

## Explanation Inheritance

## Explanation Association

## Explanation Aggregation

## Explanation Composition

## Technologies Used

- Java 11

## Prerequisities

None

## Commands

Since there are multiple classes containing main() method, each of which is targeted at highlighting one specific feature of functional programming in Java, one needs to navigate to the specific main() method and run it in an IDE. 

## Contribution

Feature requests, issues, pull requests and questions are welcome.
